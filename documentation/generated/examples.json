A **column format&** tells Coda to interpret the value in a cell by executing a formula using that value, typically looking up data related to that value from a third-party API. For example, the Weather pack has a **column format** `Current Weather`; when applied to a column, if you type a city or address into a cell in that column, that location will be used an input to a formula that fetches the current weather at that location, and the resulting object with weather info will be shown in the cell.",
